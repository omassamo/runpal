				<div class="col-md-5 col-md-offset-1">
				<p>As part of the research I'm hoping to collect a lot of run data. The reason this data is interesting for me is that I want to discover patterns and habits for runners, as I believe knowing this can help determine how to help people engage in social running.</p>
				<p>You can participate in my research by sharing your run data with me. I'm interested in data from runners of all kind no matter if you hit the streets or trails everyday in your flash gear or if running is somewhat of a coincidence for you. I will of course keep all your data totally anonymous and not share it with anyone, this is only for test purposes.</p>
				<p>Now there are tons of services out there that lets you track your runs, but exporting that data-so you can lend it to me-demands a little bit of work. I've included guides to the most popular services here. If you should have any questions abouth any of the methods don't hestitate to <a href="mailto:sprint@runpal.org">contact me</a>.

				<div class="col-md-5 col-md-offset-1"><p>Like many other services Endomondo doesn't offer a bulk export feature natively. To actually export your data (if not done one by one from the Endomondo website) the only way I've found is to use the iOS app <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/dk/app/rungap-workout-tracker/id534460198?mt=8" target="blank">Run Gap</a>. Run Gap lets you sync your data from 13 services including Endomondo, and from the app you can then export the data to dropbox. Just choose the services you want to sync and then go to "Share & Export" and choose dropbox. Run Gap will then create a folder in the Apps folder in your Dropbox, with the exported rundata. After downloading the files <a href="#upload">upload your upload files</a>. If it's not possible to choose several files (Internet Explorer) please zip and upload that .zip file.</p></div>
